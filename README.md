## what it is
this repository contains the code of the old webpage of the Computing Science Student Society (CSSS) of Simon Fraser University (SFU). 
This website was hosted on `csss.cs.sfu.ca`.

The CSSS has since moved to [sfucsss.org](http://sfucsss.org/), and the repository for the new website can be found [here](https://github.com/CSSS/csss-site).
